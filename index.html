        <p>Hi, I'm Matthew Flint, an aspiring Front End Developer with a passion for web design and coding. 
        Currently, I'm expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I transition from a career in 
        mental health support into the tech industry. My experience working as a Mental Health Key Worker
        has equipped me with strong  problem-solving abilities, empathy, and excellent communication skills,
        which I now apply to my tech journey. <br><br>I've always had a fascination with technology, starting with 
        building gaming desktops and troubleshooting complex software issues. Now, I'm focused on learning
        front-end development to create engaging, user-friendly websites and applications. I'm driven by 
        the idea of combining creativity with functionality to improve the digital experience for users.<br><br>
        My career goal is to grow as a Front End Developer, continuously learning new tools and technologies
        like React and UX/UI design, and contribute to meaningful projects that solve real-world problems.<br><br>
        Feel free to check out my projects and connect with meâ€”I'm always open to feedback, collaboration,
        and new opportunities!
        </p>
