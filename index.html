        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm Matthew Flint, an aspiring Front End Developer with a passion for web design and coding. 
        Currently, I'm expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript<br> as I transition from a career in mental health support into the tech industry. 
        My experience working as a Mental Health Key Worker has equipped me with strong<br> problem-solving abilities, empathy, and excellent communication skills, 
        which I now apply to my tech journey. I've always had a fascination with technology, <br>starting with building gaming desktops and troubleshooting 
        complex software issues. Now, I'm focused on learning front-end development to create engaging,<br> user-friendly websites and applications. I'm driven 
        by the idea of combining creativity with functionality to improve the digital experience for users. <br> My career goal is to grow as a Front End 
        Developer, continuously learning new tools and technologies like React and UX/UI design, and contribute to meaningful<br> projects that solve real-world 
        problems. Feel free to check out my projects and connect with meâ€”I'm always open to feedback, collaboration, and new opportunities!
        </p>
