        <p>Hi, I'm Matthew Flint, an aspiring Front End Developer with a passion for web design and coding. <br>
        Currently, I'm expanding my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as I transition from a career in <br>
        mental health support into the tech industry. My experience working as a Mental Health Key Worker<br>
        has equipped me with strong  problem-solving abilities, empathy, and excellent communication skills,<br> 
        which I now apply to my tech journey. I've always had a fascination with technology, starting with<br> 
        building gaming desktops and troubleshooting complex software issues. Now, I'm focused on learning<br>
        front-end development to create engaging, user-friendly websites and applications. I'm driven by<br> 
        the idea of combining creativity with functionality to improve the digital experience for users.<br>
        My career goal is to grow as a Front End Developer, continuously learning new tools and technologies<br>
        like React and UX/UI design, and contribute to meaningful projects that solve real-world problems.<br>
        Feel free to check out my projects and connect with meâ€”I'm always open to feedback, collaboration,<br>
        and new opportunities!
